# AI Chatbot with Backend

This project is a simple AI chatbot that uses OpenAI's API to generate responses. It consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend implemented in Python using Flask. The chatbot allows users to interact with an AI model and receive responses in real-time.

## Features

- User-friendly chat interface
- Real-time interaction with AI
- Sample conversation included to demonstrate functionality
- Secure handling of OpenAI API key

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, OpenAI SDK
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS for handling cross-origin requests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (optional, for any additional frontend tooling)
- An OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup))

Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
Running the Application
Start the backend server:

bash
Run
Copy code
python app.py
The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Open the frontend:
